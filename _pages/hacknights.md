  This is an informal, but guided study group for different topics in art and technology. We usually run an introductory class which meets once a week to learn programming and electronics using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platforms. We also run Special Topic sessions which, in addition to being a bit more advanced, usually reflect some of the research being done in the lab, some aspect of a recent exhibition, or current social events.
