The lab started as a temporary residency space within the [Build Your Own](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/build-your-own-tools-for-sharing.aspx) exhibition at FACT. It was created to expose some of the creative and technical processes behind current artistic practices.

Throughout the 3-month exhibition the lab hosted visiting artists, supported the development of new works, and provided a physical location for workshops and skill-sharing events. The lab also served as a short-term production facility for other artists, workshops and events taking place at FACT during the exhibition months.

Since then, it has been an accompanying feature for two [other](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/lesions-in-the-landscape.aspx) major [exhibitions](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/follow.aspx) at FACT.

It has been a great way for engaging with the artistic community in Liverpool, because as a practice-based public space, it acts as a catalyst for the local creative community and recognizes that cultural institutions are places where art is made, and not just shown.
