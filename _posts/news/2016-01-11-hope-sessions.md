Earlier this week, the lab hosted a series of art+tech induction sessions for a group of 40 first-year art students from Liverpool Hope University.

The sessions were led by resident artists Radam√©s Ajna and Thiago Hersan, who prepared an introductory crash course on the history of media and electronic/digital art. The sessions then continued with a couple of hours of hands-on exercises where the students were introduced to the Linux operating system and the principles of networking, programming and physical computing, using the RaspberryPi platform.

Taking a hint from Marshall McLuhan, who said that &#8220;all media are extensions of some human faculty &#8211; psychic or physical&#8221;, the exercises were organized to expose the poetic and psychic possibilities of everyday technologies and provoke the students to think about how technologies like a web camera, or the internet, are potential manifestations of some greater human desire for supernatural powers.
