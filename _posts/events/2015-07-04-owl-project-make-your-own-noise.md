Join Manchester-based maker collective [Owl Project](http://www.owlproject.com/) and improv music makers [The Noise Upstairs](http://www.thenoiseupstairs.com/) for a series of workshops where you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to experiment with electronics to create your own unique sounds.

Throughout the sessions we will explore:
  
- experimental ways of keeping rhythm and creating sounds
  
- improvised sonic performances with other participants
  
- learning to use electrical components to create sound
