Unity is a flexible and powerful development platform for creating multiplatform 3D and 2D games and interactive experiences. In this session, a developer from [Mechabit](http://www.mechabit.co.uk/), Kevin Tsang, will help you create your very own 3D game.

Experience level: Beginner
  
No coding experience will be necessary but you will be typing some javascript during the session. Some familiarity with the Unity interface will make things run smoother but is unnecessary.
