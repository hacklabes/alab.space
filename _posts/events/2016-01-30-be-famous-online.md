In 1968 Andy Warhol supposedly said &#8220;in the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes&#8221;. Well, the future is now, and everyone can be world-wide-web famous for 15 minutes. In this workshop we will explore a specific notion of fame, based on resident artist Thiago Hersan’s app [iLikeMe (on facebook)](http://www.thiagohersan.com/project/ilikeme-on-facebook-2013/). We’ll come up with other strategies for hacking world-wide-web fame, and discuss how to implement them.
