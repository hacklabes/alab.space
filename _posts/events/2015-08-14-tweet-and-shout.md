In this two day workshop we will use computer scripts, karaoke files and online translation/pronunciation services to reinterpret and re-appropriate pop songs and make computers sing our social media streams.

This workshop is based on projects by [Thiago Hersan](http://www.thiagohersan.com/) and [Maximilian Lawrence](http://space1026.com/members/maximillian-lawrence/) who have been researching and experimenting with different kinds of voice synthesis and conceptual mashup techniques. Development support for this has been provided by [The Hacktory](https://www.thehacktory.org/) in Philadelphia and [Impakt](http://impakt.nl/) in Utrecht.
