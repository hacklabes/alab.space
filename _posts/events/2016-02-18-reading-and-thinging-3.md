Combining a reading group with a ’show and tell’ session, Reading &#038; Thinging explores themes in science, philosophy and media theory relevant to contemporary art practice through a curated reading list and discussion of objects.

Taking the closing of the Follow exhibition as inspiration, this session will explore themes of post-humanism, post-internet technologies and the Anthropocene.

The Reading and Thinging group is a collaboration between current FACT PhD researchers and FACTLab residents, as an opportunity to make different areas of research, like philosophy, media theory and robotics, open and accessible, while developing a community of readers, thinkers and thingers! that mixes theory and making.

Reading for this session included texts by [Dorion Sagan](http://www.thiagohersan.com/tmp/Sagan_intro_to_umwelt.pdf), [Bonnie Bassler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVfmUfr8VPA), [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/) and [Stafford Beer](http://thiagohersan.com/tmp/Beer__From_The_Cybernetic_Factory.pdf).
