Shutter Social is a monthly peer-led photography workshop hosted by [GLORYBOX](http://www.glory-box.co.uk/).

Visual artists as well as film & photo enthusiasts from all backgrounds are invited to join us for an interactive, collaborative, creative open studio session where we respond to a small brief using photography or short film.

Feel free to bring with you your instant camera, digital camera or smart phone to record images or videos. If you&#8217;d like to edit your work and have a laptop with editing software then bring this along too.

At the end of each session we will offer up the floor to anyone who would like to share a recent project with the group or get feedback on a portfolio piece.
