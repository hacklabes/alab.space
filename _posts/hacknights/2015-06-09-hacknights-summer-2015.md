An informal, but guided study group for different topics in art and technology. During the first six weeks we will introduce basic concepts of programming and electronics using tools like [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), along with basic prototyping and 3D design tools.

During the remaining six weeks, we will keep the lab open for project nights; participants can bring ideas that they want to develop, or drop in to collaborate on ongoing projects.

Code for this class is available [on github](https://github.com/hacklabes/HackNights_Intro_2015June).
