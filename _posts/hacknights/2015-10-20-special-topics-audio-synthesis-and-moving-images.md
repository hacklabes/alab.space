title: 'Special Topics: Audio Synthesis and Moving Images'
categories: hacknights
---
Inspired by themes from the film [THX1138](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138), where machines mediate most human interactions, and technology plays a vital role maintaining systems of order and control, this workshop will explore what happens when machines choose what music they want to play.

In a world where computers influence many of our daily decisions, we&#8217;ll learn how algorithms can generate sounds based on moving images. We will be using the Processing programming language to learn principles of image processing and audio synthesis, and how they can be used together to create autonomous music systems.

Code for this session is available [on github](https://github.com/hacklabes/HackNights_Sound_Synthesis).
