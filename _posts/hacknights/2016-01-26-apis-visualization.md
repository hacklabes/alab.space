In this session we’ll continue our investigation of APIs by exploring how to gather and visualize large amounts of data. We’ll use the facebook API to spy on ourselves.

Some [Processing](https://processing.org/) or programming experience would be nice.

For this session we will need:
  
&#8211; [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/releases) ([or](http://lighttable.com/) [any](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) [other](https://atom.io/) text editor for code)
  
&#8211; [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

For a bit of inspiration, check out this completely [analog data-viz project](http://www.dear-data.com/by-week/).

Code to make your own Facebook Astrology chart and mandala can be found [on github](https://github.com/hacklabes/HackNights_API_Visualization/).
