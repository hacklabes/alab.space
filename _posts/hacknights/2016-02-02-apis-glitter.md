In this session weâ€™ll continue our investigation of APIs by exploring how to automatically post data onto different social media platforms.

Some [Processing](https://processing.org/) or programming experience would be nice.

Code for this session is [up on github](https://github.com/hacklabes/HackNights_API_Glitter).
