In these sessions we will introduce two different methods and two different tools for designing objects in 3D: [Fusion360](http://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/fusion-360/) and [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/).

Code for this session is available [on github](https://github.com/hacklabes/HackNights_OpenSCAD).
