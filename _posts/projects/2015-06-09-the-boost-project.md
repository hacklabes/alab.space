The Boost Project by [Ant Hamlyn](http://anthamlyn.co.uk/) is an interactive, living installation exploring how social media allows us to live within an alternate reality; one in which we can easily attain a heightened sense of belonging or a temporal state of appreciation. The inflating orb aims to emulate the acceptance and self worth we can feel after receiving ‘likes’ on our posts or pictures online.

The orb gradually increases in size each time it is followed [@BoostFACT](https://twitter.com/BoostFACT), receives a [like on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/THEBOOSTPROJECT2015), or is hash-tagged [#THEBOOSTPROJECT](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/theboostproject/) via Instagram or Twitter. If ignored, it begins to subtly deflate over time and fade into the background of our lives. Watch it live [here](http://theboostproject.biz).

The project was commissioned for the [Follow](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/follow.aspx) exhibition at FACT and developed through a 3-month residency in the lab, with guidance and assistance from Radamés Ajna, Thiago Hersan, Mike Shorter and Cameron McGee.
