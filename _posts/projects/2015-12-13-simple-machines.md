A Simple Machine is an intimate object whose parts can be cradled in the palm of one’s hand. It consists of a nine volt battery, a small motor, and a small object attached to the motor’s spindle.

When assembled the machine will spin and twitch until its power runs out. The assembler must take responsibility for the amount of time it remains assembled as once the power is gone the machine will no longer function. Changing the battery will make a new machine but it will not be the same. In some ways this machine is like a hamster in the hands of a child.

[Alex Pearl](http://alexpearl.miriadonline.info/) spent the last couple of weeks making and placing simple machines around the private and public spaces (non exhibition) of FACT. They are made from the materials and waste available at FACT and its surroundings, and as such are part of the building itself.

These machines will act in, and record their surroundings using video and sound recording. It is hoped that they will develop an understanding of place and position within the FACT network and will look at engaging the existing machinery of FACT both human and non-human.
