[Interspecifics](http://interspecifics.cc/) is a multispecies collective experimenting in the intersection between art, science and technology. They embrace hybridized practices among different disciplines using living organisms, open knowledge and precarity as tools. Their work explores the relationship between sound, matter, electricity and other physical manifestations of frequencies, seeking a pattern-based understanding of different organic and synthetic systems that intimately rely on vibrations to communicate.
