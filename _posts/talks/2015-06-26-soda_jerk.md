Soda_Jerk have been working on a new installment in their ongoing multi-channel video-cycle, Astro Black. Informed by cultural theories of Afrofuturism and taking the cosmic jazz musician Sun Ra as a point of departure, this speculative history seeks to draw out the nexus of science fiction and social politics in Black Atlantic culture. During their stay they have been researching Liverpool’s connection to Black Atlantic politics and histories, as well as the city’s vibrant and diverse music history and scene.
