C H R Θ M A create public, participatory events that explore the flexible relationship between the physical and the virtual using experimental performance together with immersive and interactive technologies.

Their work has taken place in theatre settings and art galleries as well as unusual site-specific installations where the audience’s perception, bodies and movement become a vital part of the experience.
