[Ghana ThinkTank](http://ghanathinktank.org/) is an ever-growing collective/network that has been “Developing the First World&#8221; since 2006. They collect problems in so called “developed” countries, and send them to think tanks established in Cuba, Ghana, Iran, Mexico, El Salvador, and the U.S. prison system, where these problems can be analyzed and solved.
