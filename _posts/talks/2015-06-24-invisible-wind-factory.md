[Invisible Wind Factory](http://www.invisiblewindfactory.com/) is a Liverpool-based arts collective comprising of members from the Kazimier, who create experiences, taking audiences on voyages of augmented reality; manipulating senses, exploring the spectrum of human emotion; taking individuals into reflective isolation or exploring the euphoria of unifying a collective.

They inhabit a large building on Liverpoolâ€™s North Docks containing a series of fabrication, sound and electronic workshops and an 8000 square foot Realisation Arena.
